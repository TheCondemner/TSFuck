# Brainfuck Compiler

## Information

This is a simple `.bf` compiler written in TypeScript, and then compiled to JavaScript.


## Utilization

Write all your `.bf` code within the `source/` directory, and then run `npm run compile` within your command line.

The selected files will then appear compiled within the `out/` directory, whereby you can run `npm run execute` to execute the files.


## Editing

Refer to the `typescript/README.md` for general information on editing the compiler itself.
